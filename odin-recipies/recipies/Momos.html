    <b><i><u>Momos:-</u></i></b>
    <p>Momo is a type of steamed dumpling with some form of filling, most commonly chicken (traditionally yak, but often
        chicken and goat) and it is originally from Tibet. Momo has become a delicacy in Tibet, Nepal, Bhutan and the
        Indian communities of Darjeeling, Sikkim and Kalimpong.</p>
    <p>A simple white-flour-and-water dough is generally preferred to make the outer momo covering. Sometimes, a little
        yeast or baking soda is added to give a more doughy texture to the finished product.

        Traditionally, momo is prepared with ground/minced meat, potatoes, and leek filling. Nowadays, the fillings have
        become more elaborate and Momo is prepared with virtually any combination of ground meat, vegetables, tofu,
        mushrooms, paneer cheese, soft chhurpi (local hard cheese) and vegetable and meat combinations.

    </p>
    <p>Momos are traditionally steamed but can also be deep-fried or pan-fried and cooked in soup. It is usually served
        with chilli garlic sauce and pickled daikon in Tibet. In Nepal, popular dipping sauces include tomato-based
        chutneys or sesame or peanut or soybean-based sauces called achar. Sauces can be thick or thin in consistency
        depending on the eatery.[15] In Kathmandu valley, the traditional way of serving momo (called momochƒÅ or local
        momo) is ten ping-pong ball-sized round momo drowned in a sauce called jhol achar, infused with Timur pepper
        (Nepali pepper, a variety of Sichuan pepper).</p>
